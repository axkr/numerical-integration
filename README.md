# numerical-integration
This library contains standard and state-of-the-art algorithms for estimating integrals of functions in 1D and limits of sequences and series in Java, many of which are not currently implemented in Commons Math.

The main features are:
- over a dozen algorithms for estimating integrals of 1D functions
- support for variable transformations, oscillatory and indefinite integrals
- algorithms for estimating limits of sequences and series in double and high (e.g. arbitrary) precision
